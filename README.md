 **ABOUT my web project:**

------------
- *Building Management System (BMS) is an online platform for managing properies, located in a single block of flats. Some of the properties could be rented for long-term period.*

- *The platform meets owners, tenants and property manager needs for easy ant transperant management. Quite often, the owners don't live close to their properties. They could even live in another country. Managing their properties scattered everywhere, is a challenge.*
